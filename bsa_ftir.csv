# Peak Deconvolution Results:
# Amide I region (1600-1700 cm⁻¹):
# Component 1: 1652 cm⁻¹ (52%) - α-helix
# Component 2: 1633 cm⁻¹ (28%) - β-sheet  
# Component 3: 1645 cm⁻¹ (15%) - Random coil
# Component 4: 1675 cm⁻¹ (5%) - β-turns

# Protein Information:
# Name: Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
# MW: 66,500 Da
# Residues: 583
# Structure: Mixed α/β (67% helix, 10% sheet)
# Sample: D2O solution, 10 mg/mL
# Temperature: 25°C
# Path length: 50 μm CaF2 cell

# Key Spectral Features:
# 1. Amide I (1600-1700 cm⁻¹): C=O stretch
#    - Main peak at 1652 cm⁻¹ indicates high α-helix content
#    - Shoulder at 1633 cm⁻¹ indicates some β-sheet
# 
# 2. Amide II (1500-1600 cm⁻¹): N-H bend + C-N stretch
#    - Peak at 1540 cm⁻¹ (shifts in D2O due to H/D exchange)
#
# 3. Absence of 1625 cm⁻¹ peak: No aggregation/amyloid

# Applications:
# - Secondary structure determination
# - Protein folding/unfolding studies
# - Aggregation monitoring (amyloid formation)
# - Drug-protein interactions
# - Quality control (biopharmaceuticals)

# Reference:

# Typical α-helix: 1650-1658 cm⁻¹
# Typical β-sheet: 1625-1640 cm⁻¹
# Random coil: 1640-1648 cm⁻¹
