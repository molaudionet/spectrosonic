# Notes:
# - Prolines (P) at positions 19, 37, 38 have no NH, hence no HSQC peak
# - Chemical shift ranges:
#   1H: 8.08-8.56 ppm (typical backbone NH)
#   15N: 109.5-126.1 ppm (typical backbone N)
# - Glycines appear at lower 15N shifts (~110 ppm)
# - Well-dispersed peaks indicate well-folded protein
# - Intensities vary due to dynamics and relaxation

# Reference: BMRB Entry 6457, Cornilescu et al.
# Protein: Human ubiquitin (76 residues, 8.6 kDa)
# pH 6.5, Temperature 298 K
