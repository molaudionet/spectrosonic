# Imino Proton Assignments:
# G-C base pairs: NH1 of guanine (13-14 ppm)
# A-T base pairs: NH3 of thymine (12-13 ppm)

# Peak Details:
# 1. G2:C11 at 13.95 ppm - Internal G-C (most protected)
# 2. G10:C3 at 13.92 ppm - Internal G-C
# 3. G4:C9 at 13.85 ppm - Internal G-C
# 4. G12:C1 at 13.80 ppm - Terminal G-C (slightly shifted)
# 5. T8:A5 at 13.15 ppm - Central A-T (in AT tract)
# 6. T7:A6 at 13.10 ppm - Central A-T (in AT tract)
# 7-8. Terminal bases show broader, weaker peaks (end fraying)

# Structural Information:
# - Well-defined B-DNA helix
# - Central AATT region shows A-tract characteristics
# - All base pairs intact (no breathing observed at 25°C)
# - Terminal base pairs slightly destabilized (weaker, shifted peaks)

# Experimental Conditions:
# Temperature: 25°C (298 K)
# pH: 7.0
# Buffer: 10 mM phosphate, 100 mM NaCl
# DNA concentration: 2 mM (duplex)
# D2O: 10% for lock signal
