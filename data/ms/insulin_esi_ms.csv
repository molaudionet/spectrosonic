# Protein Information:
# Name: Human insulin
# Total mass: 5806.5 Da
# A-chain: 2383.4 Da (21 residues)
# B-chain: 3429.9 Da (30 residues)
# Disulfide bonds: 3 (A6-A11, A7-B7, A20-B19)
# Sequence: 
#   A-chain: GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN
#   B-chain: FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKT

# Post-Translational Modifications Detected:
# 1. Native: Three disulfide bonds intact (5806.5 Da)
# 2. Oxidation: Met at B-chain (+16 Da) - common artifact
# 3. Deamidation: Asn to Asp (+1 Da) - degradation product
# 4. Reduced: All disulfides broken (+6 H, -74 Da)

# Peak Annotations:
# [M+H]+ : Singly charged molecular ion
# [M+2H]2+: Doubly charged (most abundant for ESI)
# [M+3H]3+: Triply charged (common for proteins >5 kDa)
# [M+nH]n+: Multiply charged states
